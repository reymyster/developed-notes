# Introduction

Welcome to **Developed Notes** — a working photographer’s notebook.

I’m a glamour and boudoir photographer who spends a lot of time not only behind the camera, but also experimenting with the gear, software, and little details that make each shoot smoother, more creative, and more fun.

Over time, I realized I kept hearing the same question:

> _What do you actually use, and what do you really recommend?_

That’s what this space is for.

Here, you’ll find **practical notes on the equipment, software, and accessories I rely on daily**. Some are big-ticket investments; others are small but indispensable tools that make a surprising difference. Everything here earned its place in my kit — not because it’s trendy, but because it’s been tested in the real world.

This isn’t a traditional review site. Think of it like leafing through a fellow photographer’s notebook: honest impressions, shortcuts, and context for **why** something works (or doesn’t).

If you’re just starting out, I hope you’ll find guidance here. If you’re established, maybe you’ll discover a change that streamlines your workflow or sparks inspiration.

Pull up a chair, flip through the notes, and let’s keep developing together.
